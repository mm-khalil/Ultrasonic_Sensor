# Ultrasonic_Sensor
Obstacle avoidance by Ultrasonic sensor.

Ultrasonic sensors are used for many applications like obstacle avoidance/detection/navigation and much more, its uses sound waves and we calculate distance by some physics formulas  with speed of sound, time and distance.

In this code I write a code for ultrasonic sensors which is generic one and one can easily use it with any kind of ultrasonic sensor depends on its ratings pin configuration varies and not anything else.

Basically it drive 2 motors in this code after detecting an obstacle which is checked or calibrated up to 10cm and change its direction accordingly which is same for 1 sensor for multiple you can just copy that code and paste at same location and just change the names of variables accordingy.
